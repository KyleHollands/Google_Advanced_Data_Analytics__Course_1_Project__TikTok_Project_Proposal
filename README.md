# Google_Advanced_Data_Analytics__Course_1_Project__TikTok_Project_Proposal

The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify whether a video provides 
a claim or offers an opinion. This model will help alleviate some of the workload of the moderators who 
need to manually vet these claims.
