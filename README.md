# Video Claim vs. Opinion Classification
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify whether a video provides a claim or offers an opinion. This model is intended to help reduce the workload of moderators who currently need to manually vet these claims.

## Data Understanding
The project uses video content data, including features relevant to determining whether a video expresses a claim or an opinion. This data serves as the input for model training and evaluation.

## Modeling and Evaluation
A machine learning classification model is developed to predict the type of video content. Evaluation will focus on the modelâ€™s ability to accurately identify claims and opinions, aiming to support moderators in managing content efficiently.

## Conclusion
The model provides a tool to assist moderators by automating the classification of videos, potentially improving efficiency and reducing the burden of manual content review.
